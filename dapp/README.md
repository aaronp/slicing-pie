# Svelte SPA

This is a simple starting block for a new [svelte](https://svelte.dev/) single-page app.

It's the easiest baseline for creating a new sveltekit project which bundles into a static site.

# Usage

To use it, just clone this repo and search and replace 'my-app-name' for your app name

# Building

To develop on it, run `make run` and code away.

To build it, run `make docker` and then `docker run -p 3000:3000  docker.io/kindservices/my-app-name:0.0.1` to run
